# Lesson 4: Create a Certificate

We must create the certificate to secure the communication between the IoT device and the amazon server(s) that will receive the information that our IoT device will create.

Click on the Resource Panel and select the option Create a certificate:

Just Click on the 1 Click certificate create button.
AWS will create the certificate to establish the connection with the amazon server and the public and private key. Please download and store it in a safe place we will use it later to configure the Edison device.

This is the example / test certificates that I download, please verify that you have 3 similar files.

After you confirm that you have the 3 files (one certificate, one public key and one private key, please close the Create Panel.


By default the certificate its INACTIVE, please select your certificate and active it.
