### **Exercise 1: Create your access key ID and secret access key**


Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS. If you don't have access keys, you can create them by using the AWS Management Console. We recommend that you use IAM access keys instead of AWS root account access keys. IAM lets you securely control access to AWS services and resources in your AWS account.


1. Choose your AWS user name.

3.Choose the Security Credentials tab and then choose Create Access Key.


5.To see your access key, choose Show User Security Credentials. Your credentials will look something like this: 


•Access Key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE


•Secret Access Key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY



6.Choose Download Credentials, and store the keys in a secure location. 

Your secret key will no longer be available through the AWS Management Console; you will have the only copy. Keep it confidential in order to protect your account, and never email it. Do not share it outside your organization, even if an inquiry appears to come from AWS or Amazon.com. No one who legitimately represents Amazon will ever ask you for your secret key.
